# folder-creator
# [folder.py file]

Earlier Feature -

This Python program allows users to create multiple folders in a specified directory. The program asks the user for two inputs:

The path of the directory where they want to create the folders.
A list of folder names separated by commas.

# [test.py file]

New Features -

- Option to Rename Folders**: After creating the folders, the user is prompted with the choice to rename folders or exit the program.

- User-Defined Number of Renames**: The user can choose how many folders they want to rename, rather than being restricted to a fixed number.

- Case-Insensitive Renaming**: The code handles renaming folders even if the new name only differs in letter case, by using a temporary name as an intermediate step.


Once the folders are created, the user has the option to rename any number of them based on their preference, streamlining the folder management process. No need to manually create or rename folders one by oneâ€”this script helps save time and improve efficiency!
